		<h1><u> History of the Institute</u></h1>
		
		
		
		<p>Government College University, Faisalabad has emerged as a leading center of learning and research in a short span of time. The University with its dynamic faculty and innovative syllabi has become a catalyst of intellectual, social and industrial change. It caters to the diverse needs of society by imparting education in almost all the major fields of learning.</p>
		<p>The Government College University’s journey started as a primary school in 1897 in the present building of Govt. College for Women, Karkhana Bazar, Faisalabad. It was promoted to High School and Intermediate College in 1905 and 1924 respectively. It was elevated to the degree level in 1933 and postgraduate disciplines were introduced in 1963. The long journey that started with the humble beginning reached its climax when it was granted the status of University in October 2002.</p>
		<p>The Government College University, Faisalabad has a long history of excellence and distinction as an institution. Renowned scholars and eminent personalities have served this institution in various capacities at various stages of its history. It has produced outstanding personnel who have earned great fame not only for themselves but also for the nation.</p>
		<p>The luminaries like Mr. Abdul Hameed, Mr. W.H.F. Armstrong, Mr. Lala Chattan Annand, Mr. Hashmat Khan, Mr. Taj Khyal, Mr. Namdar Khan, Mr. Karamat Hussain Jafari, Mr. Mukhtar Mahmood Qureshi, Dr. Asif Iqbal Khan and Dr. Arif Zaidi have served this institution.</p>
		<p>The university is situated at the Jhang Road not far from the historical Clock Tower. The main campus is spread on 37 acres and the construction of new campus has been started on an area of 200 acres some 3-4 kilometers away from the main campus at Jhang Road.</p>
		<p>The University is offering educational degrees in different disciplines. The University is a hub of educational, social and cultural activities with a close liaison with industry.</p>
		
		<h2><u>School Era</u></h2>

		<p>The Middle School, opened by Lala Jowala Das in 1897, was raised to a High School in1905. Chaudhri Fateh-ud-Din, who some years back, retired from the Punjab education service as inspector of schools, Multan Division, was the first headmaster of the high school. To the historiographer, the institution presents the appearance of a rapidly growing youth, who is constantly outgrowing his garments. The high school began to grow in numbers and reputation and it had the exceptional good luck of having a succession of very competent headmasters ….. man who had made their mark in the service. In 1908 Sardar Mohan Singh took over from Chaudhri Fateh-ud-Din, and in turn made over to Lala Harkishen Das, M.A., who remained in charge of the school from 1909 to 1919.</p>
		<p>During the headmastership of Lala Harkishen Das the school became very popular, and the records state that the old building (now occupied by the Government Intermediate College for Woman) was soon found to be insufficient for the requirements of the school. With the sympathetic support of Col. Douglas, the then Deputy Commissioner of Lyallpur, Lala Harkishen Das was able to persuade the department to sanction a grant for the new building. Lala Harkishen Das, who has since retired from the service, mentions that the keen personal interest in the matter taken by the late Rai Bahadur Sundar Das Suri, the then Inspector of schools, was of great help to him in securing the building grant of Rs. 1, 15, 000*. The building operations were taken in hand in 1912, but it was three years before the school could be moved into the new building, which with slight alterations and a few additions forms the present building of the college. A very conspicuous feature of the present building is the lovely approach linked on both sides with artistically planted trees of thick foliage forming a beautiful avenue. It testifies to the artistic taste of the planter. The layout of the playfields also reflects credit on those who ‘broke the first sod’. The building itself has little of architectural design or beauty about it, being severely utilitarian in aspect ……. a fit commentary on the spirit of the age in which we live.</p>
		<p>Even as a school this institution was able to instill into the young minds of its alumni that love which draws out and develops the healthiest sentiments. Writing in the Degree College special number of the Beacon, an old boy of the school gives expression to his feelings in the following words:-</p>
		<p><br>“These precincts were our ‘world’ years ago. Even now, of some fine morning, when the doors are shut and nobody is near by, I go out of my way and pass through the corridors of this old school of mine. There is none who can dispute this right of old, and once again I feel like a child in the lap of its mother…..”</br></p>

<h3>Admission Process</h3>
</div>
<div id="scale">Almost fifty percent of the girl students of the university belong to different areas which are far from Faisalabad. Parents of these students always seek secure and peaceful residence for their daughters. Understanding this need of the hour university has planned another project of Four hostels for the girls that will be completed in next year. In this way we will be able to accommodate maximum of our girl students coming from far flung areas to quench their thirst of knowledge.
